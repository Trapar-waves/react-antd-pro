> A professional-grade React project built with Ant Design, TanStack tools, and Rsbuild for optimized performance and developer experience.

## ✨ Features

* Modern UI Framework: Built using React 19 for a component-driven interface, ensuring high performance and flexibility.
* Rich Component Library: Integrates with Ant Design (`antd`) and Pro Components (`@ant-design/pro-components`), providing pre-built UI elements for enterprise-level applications.
* Type Safety: Leverages TypeScript to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.
* Fast Development Workflow: Utilizes Rsbuild (`@rsbuild/core`) for quick server starts, optimized builds, and efficient development cycles.
* Predictable State Management: Manages application state using Zustand (`zustand`), offering a lightweight and intuitive API for state handling.
* Client-Side Routing: Implements routing via TanStack Router (`@tanstack/react-router`), enabling smooth Single Page Application (SPA) navigation.
* Efficient Data Fetching: Handles API interactions using Axios (`axios`) and manages server state with TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`).
* Utility-First Styling: Employs Tailwind CSS (`tailwindcss`) for flexible and rapid styling, allowing for highly customizable UIs.
* Focus on Testing and Debugging: Includes TanStack Query DevTools (`@tanstack/react-query-devtools`) and Router DevTools (`@tanstack/react-router-devtools`), indicating attention to code reliability and debugging capabilities.
* Immutability Helpers: Uses Immer (`immer`) for managing immutable state updates in a predictable and developer-friendly manner.
